# Glitterbot Mobile MyApplication
This branch is dedicated to the development of the mobile app required by the group project specifications.
The app should act like the drone, it should send precise GPS coordinates to the server which should display the location on the website. In order to get precise GPS coordinates we need take into consideration the error rate of the default GPS sensor.

## Prerequisites
Android Studio
## Getting Started
Clone the branch and add the "MyApplication" as a project to Android Studio. Android studio should take care of sdk locations and other dependencies.

## Currently in development
* Kalman filter: We're currently studying how to apply the kalman filter to the values of acceleration taken from the mobile phone sensors and the GPS coordinates.
